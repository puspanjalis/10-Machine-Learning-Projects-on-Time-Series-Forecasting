# 10 Machine Learning Projects on Time Series Forecasting

Time series analysis helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time. Using data visualizations, business users can see seasonal trends and dig deeper into why these trends occur. With modern analytics platforms, these visualizations can go far beyond line graphs.

Here, 10 Machine Learning projects on Time Series Forecasting solved and explained with the Python programming language for self-study.
